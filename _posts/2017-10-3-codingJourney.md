I think it started with a local coding bootcamp. The lady there said I would be accepted to it if I completed a certain amount of coursework before a certain date.  She sent me a link to the online coding coursework.  Depending on my goals for that week, I would get up at 2, 3, or 4:00 in the morning, make coffee, sit in front of my desktop computer, and start the python coding challenges.  I would get as much done as I could before I had to leave home for my construction job.  Then I would hit it again in the evening after dinner.  I only told two trusted co-workers what I was up to at 3:00 in the morning and why I was tired every day.  

I had been a journeyman floorlayer, a journeyman carpenter,  started my own construction business, and I was fed up.  I had reached a dead-end in how I thought about the business.  Maybe it was because I thought I was no longer learning.   

But I was excited!  I felt like I was getting smarter instead of dumber every day.  This might sound a bit strange, but getting up at 3:00 in the morning and doing coding challenges was pretty damn cool.  It got my blood flowing even when I didn't solve the challenge, which was most days.  But I solved enough coding challenges to decide that this is something I can do and excel at.  I felt like I was figuring out how the world really functions.

After awhile, I came to the decision that the bootcamp was not the way forward for me.  I didn't want to be put on a waiting list.  I wanted to move forward every day.  But this turned out to be a good thing.

Because I found a software developer apprenticeship where I am not ignored. I have a bad-ass mentor available to me to answer questions when I inevitably get stumped.  Instead of just one, I am now learning a variety of languages - JavaScript, AngularJS, Ruby, SQL, etc. - as well as becoming fluent in using the terminal and git version control.  Sometimes a door closing on you is a good thing.
