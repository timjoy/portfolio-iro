I think it started with a local coding bootcamp. The lady there said I would be accepted to it if I completed a certain amount of coursework before a certain date.  She sent me a link to the online coding coursework.  Depending on my goals for that week, I would get up at 2, 3, or 4:00 in the morning, make coffee, sit in front of my desktop computer, and start the python coding challenges.  I would get as much done as I could before I had to leave home for my construction job.  Then I would hit it again in the evening after dinner.  I only told two trusted co-workers what I was up to at 3:00 in the morning and why I was tired every day.  

I had been a journeyman floorlayer, a journeyman carpenter,  started my own construction business, and now I was fed up.  I had reached a dead-end in how I thought about the business.  I was just done with it.  Enough is enough.   

But I was excited!  I felt like I was getting smarter instead of dumber every day.  This might sound a bit strange, but getting up at 3:00 in the morning and doing coding challenges was pretty damn cool.  It got my blood flowing, even when I didn't solve the challenge, which was most days.  I felt like I was peeking through a window with a view of how the world really functions.

After awhile, I finally picked up on the hints I was given about the bootcamp.  The lady there was slow to return my emails, if she returned them at all.  In the publicity the bootcamp received, they were always sure to emphasize that they were looking for women.  This is great, except for the fact that I am not a woman.  I finally got the hint that it was time to move on, which was probably the best thing to happen.

Because I found a software developer apprenticeship where I am not ignored. I have a bad-ass mentor available to me to answer questions when I inevitably get stumped.  Instead of just one, I am now learning a variety of languages - JavaScript, AngularJS, Ruby, etc. - as well as becoming fluent in using the terminal and git version control.  Sometimes a door closing on you is a good thing.
