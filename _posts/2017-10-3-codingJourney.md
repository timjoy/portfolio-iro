I started tinkering with code on my free time, then I contacted a local coding bootcamp. The lady there said I would be accepted to it if I completed a certain amount of coursework before a certain date.  She sent me a link to the online coding coursework.  Depending on my goals for that week, I would get up at 2, 3, or 4:00 in the morning, make coffee, sit in front of my desktop computer, and start the python coding challenges.  I would get as much done as I could before I had to leave home for work.  Then I would hit it again in the evening after dinner.    

I had been a journeyman floorlayer, a journeyman carpenter, and started my own construction business.  I was ready for a change.  Maybe it was because I thought I was no longer learning.   

But coding gave me energy.  I felt like my brain was expanding every day.   Getting up at 3:00 in the morning and doing coding challenges was fun.  It got my blood flowing even when I didn't solve the challenge.  I solved enough coding challenges to decide that this is something I can do and excel at.  

After awhile, I came to the decision that the bootcamp was not the way forward for me.  I didn't want to be put on a waiting list.  I wanted to move forward every day.  But this turned out to be a good thing.

I found a software developer apprenticeship that I look forward to every day. I have a knowledgeable mentor available to me to answer questions when I inevitably get stumped.  Instead of just one, I am now learning a variety of languages - JavaScript, AngularJS, Ruby/Rails, SQL, etc. - as well as becoming fluent in using the terminal and git version control.  Change is a good thing.
